Minimum spanning tree:
ST is the tree that can connect all nodes using certain edges. Graph could have multiple STs.
An MST is the ST that uses the least weight to connect all nodes.
MST could be found using Prims algorithm or Kruskal’s Algorithm.

# What is Prim's algo:
Steps involved in Prim’s algorithms are mentioned below:

Step 1: Choose any vertex as a starting vertex.
Step 2: Pick an edge connecting any tree vertex and fringe vertex (adjacent vertex to visited vertex) having the minimum edge weight. 
Step 3: Add the selected edge to MST only if it doesn't form any closed cycle.
Step 4: Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the fringe vertices exist.
Step 5: End

# What is Kruskal algo:
It uses Greedy approach. Kruskal's approach sorts all the edges in ascending order of edge weights and only adds nodes to the tree if the chosen edge does not form a cycle. 
It also selects the edge with the lowest cost first and the edge with the highest cost last. 
As a result, we can say that the Kruskal algorithm makes a locally optimum decision in the hopes of finding the global optimal solution.
Step 1: Sort all edges in increasing order of their edge weights.
Step 2: Pick the smallest edge.
Step 3: Check if the new edge creates a cycle or loop in a spanning tree.
Step 4: If it doesn’t form the cycle, then include that edge in MST. Otherwise, discard it.
Step 5: Repeat from step 2 until it includes |V| - 1 edges in MST.
