# Selenium UI automation framework using Python with Page Object Model

**Prerequisite**
* Python should be installed

## How to run
* pull the repository in your machine.
* Install selenium package
* Run command from project home <dir> "python3 -m Tests.TestRunner"


# IMPLEMENTATION
* Separated tests, data and pages using page object model.
* Avoid harcoding, to make the code cleaner and maintanabl.
* Too much waits also would make tests brittle or slow, as usually UI tests are.
* Made class structure simple.
