M-way trees
- Multiple keys and multiple children
- m-1 keys in a node, and m children for the node.
- Its like an extention on BST. BST will have 2 or less children, while Mway could have more than 2.
- A general M way will not have any guidelines on insertion/deletion, which makes it less efficient.

B Tree
- It is a M-way tree with set of guidelines.
    - Every node must have atleasy m/2 children, once this is satisfied we think of creating a new node. This control max height of a tree.
    - root can have minimum 2 children
    - All leaf nodes at same level
    - Tree is created in bottom up approach


B+ Tree
- Its same as B Tree, but only leaf nodes will have Record pointers. The non-leaf will have keys.
- Used in modern RDBMS sustems. Its reduced IO for disc, by reducing total reads, in logn ops.


Binary Tree:
- Max no of nodes at l level is 2^l
- Max no of total nodes are 2^h-1

Binary Search Tree:
- Left subtree contains values/keys lesser than that of Root, 
- Right subtree contains values/keys greater than that of Root
- Both left and right subtrees are BST
