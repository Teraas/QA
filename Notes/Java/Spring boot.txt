	1. The Sprint framework used Beans, which are the backbone of the Spring framework.
	2. Beans are actually used as a config, to initialize objects by injecting Dependencies, which is done by IOC controllers. It helps the application manager classes/dependencies when they are in large numbers.

Creating application / Rest services:
	1. @RestController
	2. @GetMapping("/path")
	Public String greet(@RequestParam String name) { // logic}
	3. Extract path variable using @PathVariable
	@GetMapping("/user/{id}/name)
	Public String greet(@PathVariable(value="id") int userId) {/sdsds}
	4. Get request headers with @RequestHeader(value="Accept-language")


Testing Spring boot application
	1. @RunWith(SprintRunner.class)
	2. @ContextConfiguration or @SpringBootTest
	3. @AutoWired / @MockBean / @SpyBean to add dependency in test classes.
	4. @Before to initialize dependencies.
	5. @Test
	6. AssertJ for validations.
