Represent a Binary Tree as an Array:
- Node at ith
- Left child at 2i+1
- right child at 2i+2
- Level Order traversal



Full Binary Tree:
- All nodes till H are having 2 children

Complete Binary Tree
- Height is logN --- total elemenst max 2pow(h+1)-1
- till H-1 the tree will be Full BT
- leaves at H level will be contunuous from left to right


Max Heap:
- its a Complete BT
- Root is having value larger or equal thank its children
- Can have duplicates
- Insertion
    - always think of array represenatation of it, insert at the end 
    - to satisfy order of maxHeap, start comparing the new node with its parent do swap when required.
- Deletion
    - If parent is deleted, last child in H level replaces the deleted parent

Min Heap:
- its a Complete BT
- Root is the smaller or equal to its children
- Can have duplicates
