Consumer Groups:
- Consumers in a Group

- If a producer publishes a msg in a topic, consumer subscribes to a topic. Consumer cmay or may not have a consumer group.
- If the Kafka is configured with Fan-Out setting, a msg could be sent to all consumer groups subscribed to the topic.
- If multiple consumers are in a Group, only 1 consumer recieves the data which insure better parallelisation.
- Kafka also provides Point-to-Point Semantics, where if a msg is published and multiple COnsumer Groups, the configuration can help multiple consumer group recieving the copy of data from the topic but each msg gets consumed by one consumer-group




Typic vs Partition vs Replication https://stackoverflow.com/a/63167468
if COnsumers in a Group are less than no of partitions, then all the paritions will be consumed by the consumers.
If COnsumers in a Group are more than no of partitions, then consumers as many as paritions will be consuming the data. Rest of the consumers will be idle.

Partitions can be distributed in broker instances/machine. Similarly replicas also.
Among the replicas of the partitions, one will be leader and rest will be follower. this gives fault tolernce.
