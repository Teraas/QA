Teck Stack
    - Keep product and market fit tech stacks, otherwise talent management is difficult
    - logging tools - ELK or EFK
    - APM tools - NewRelic or DataDog
    - status code monitoring on cloud consoles
    - Distributed Tracing can be solved through tools like Zipkin and AWS X-Ray
    -Services shuld have a standard way of reporting key metrics like CPU, Memory, Disk, and App Metrics and push into ELK, NewRelic, Datadog or CloudWatch

Standard configurations for tolernce:
    - limit the number of incoming calls from a service
    - ability to cut off incoming and outgoing requests from/to a service

Standardise Routes and Endpoints, pagintion, limmit/offsets, Retry, timeouts, payload type

Hysterix fir curcuit breakers
gRPC for service to service communication, REST for endpoints
Redis for cache [advantages]
Prometheous for metrics
Service DIscovery - Edureka, Consul, Zoopeeker
