# creating a table
# example 1 -- single partition key
CREATE TABLE temperature_by_country (country text, city text, weather_station test, temperature float, time_created timestamp, PRIMARY KEY (country,city, weather_station,time_created));
- primary key is a compound, in the group first column acts as partition key. country is partition key here.
# example 2 -- single partition key
CREATE TABLE temperature_by_country (country text, city text, weather_station test, temperature float, time_created timestamp, PRIMARY KEY (weather_station,country,city,time_created));
- primary key is a compound, in the group first column acts as partition key. weather_station is partition key here.

# example 3 -- compound partition key
CREATE TABLE temperature_by_country (country text, city text, weather_station test, temperature float, time_created timestamp, PRIMARY KEY ((weather_station,country),city,time_created));
- primary key is a compound, in the group first column acts as partition key. weather_station and country is partition key here.

# select query example -- single partition key
- To query data for a column, we need to pass partition key clause as well, as cassandra queries for a partition.

# clustering key
- Within a partition, the clustering key sorts the rows

The partition key decides in which node/parition the record goes. Same way, during query also we should send so read would be efficient.

# Tombstones
This is db cleanup staretgy. If a records= is to be deleted, it is marked as tombstone. And a cron/batch jobs clears the records eventually.

# Choosing a correct partition key is important before app development, so to even out data placement across partitions/nodes.
